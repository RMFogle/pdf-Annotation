# pdf-Annotation
e-PlanSoft Programming Challenge:
Given a PDF file (sample.pdf), create a web or mobile application that allows a user to annotate 
the PDF file with a red polygon. 

## Upload & Display PDF 

I used PDF.js to upload and display the PDF. The PDF is rendered to a canvas element. 

## Annotate PDF 

The HTML Canvas element allows us to render graphics on a web page. I used the MDN Web Docs - Element: mousemove event to allow the user to draw on the PDF. 

## Issues: 

Couldn't find a solution to draw a polygon with an onclick mouse event. I'll continue to do some research and work on finding a solution.
